# -Modeling-Consensus-Dynamics-in-Static-and-Switching-Networks
Explored how agents reach consensus in static and switching networks using averaging algorithms. Analyzed Laplacian eigenvalues, derived stability conditions, and simulated convergence behavior in Octave to study how network structure affects agreement.
